Problem Statement: CivicEase---
In many urban and semi-urban areas, civic grievances such as potholes, broken streetlights, garbage mismanagement, and water leakage often go unaddressed due to inefficient reporting systems and lack of transparency. Citizens frequently face frustration due to bureaucratic delays, vague complaint status updates, and the absence of structured prioritization based on issue severity.
Moreover, existing systems lack intelligent categorization, leading to delays in routing the complaint to the right department. There is a pressing need for a lightweight, intuitive platform that empowers citizens to voice local issues efficiently while aiding local authorities in triaging and resolving them effectively.


Approach & Solution  : Civic Ease is an innovative platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and municipal services. It enables users to report issues such as potholes, water leakage, and streetlight outages by submitting detailed descriptions, photographs, and other proof. The system aggregates similar reports and forwards only those that meet a minimum repetition threshold to the appropriate department. After repairs, official updates—including photographic evidence—are shared on the platform for public transparency. While citizens can monitor progress, they cannot modify official entries, thereby ensuring data integrity and accountability throughout the process.
